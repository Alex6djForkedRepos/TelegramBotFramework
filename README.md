Hey guys,

here we are. After some time and thoughts i give my Telegram Bot framework to public.

It is module which is based on the original TelegramBotLibrary you will find in nuget.

It gives you features which will look/feel like WinForms or have a good way to create apps with actions and forms.

I will add more notes to it soon, so stay tuned.

Warm regards
Florian Dahn
